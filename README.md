# Calculator
This is one of the first projects I have coded. There is no sort of fault tolerance because at the time I did not know how to use loops well enough. 
But the code is very simple. The user inputs a number followed by an operation and then another number then the code returns the result based on the 
user inputs. If the user does not follow any of the directions and inputs what they are not supposed to. The code will return a sarcastic message to the 
user.
